## Description

Kapuli is an all-in-one lightweight CRM + content engine + payments + guest engagement app designed for small travel
guides and later adaptable to creators in other industries (art, dining, etc.). Guides are knowledge-rich but time-poor.
Kapuli enables them to capture content easily, manage leads, handle payments, and automatically generate marketing
assets.
